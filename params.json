Ha...ha...  \r\nAnyways, what I meant to say was:  \r\n>\"Welcome to Madicat's Cupcakes, the _happiest_ cupcake shop on Earth! Here, kids can eat cupcakes with friends, have a sweet treat, or have a magical birthday party full of their favorite thing- sugar!\r\n>At first glance, this just looks like any cupcake shop, right? Well, take a look inside and you'll meet our... _special_... staff!\"\r\n\r\nWell, there you go. There's your training.\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing- our \"staff\" is made of animatronic characters. You know, those robotic, animal-like things?   Yea...I need to warn you about those. They...um...tend to get a bit...irritable...at night. So... be careful. \r\n\r\n###Meet the Staff!\r\n\r\n* Madicat\r\n * Your adorable feline friend!\r\n * The favorite of all the animatronics!\r\n * Friendly, and approachable! (Well, in the daytime, at least...)\r\n * Cute, fluffy, and hug-able! (Unless it's past 9:00 p.m.)\r\n * The main animatronic, acts as a leader to the others.\r\n* Dee\r\n * Also known as, \"The Cupcake Chickadee\".\r\n * Based on a bird, particularly the Chickadee.\r\n * Famous for the song she sings as she works, \"Sprinkles On Top!\"\r\n * Has a slight glitch whenever someone says \"tweet\", making her shut down temporarily.\r\n * Bakes the cupcakes, and is the main singer of the animatronics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
