<p><em>You're</em> the new security guard? Ha! You won't last one night!<br>
Sorry, that was...er...just a joke! Ha...ha...<br>
Anyways, what I meant to say was:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Welcome to Madicat's Cupcakes, the <em>happiest</em> cupcake shop on Earth! Here, kids can eat cupcakes with friends, have a sweet treat, or have a magical birthday party full of their favorite thing- sugar!
At first glance, this just looks like any cupcake shop, right? Well, take a look inside and you'll meet our... <em>special</em>... staff!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there you go. There's your training.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing- our "staff" is made of animatronic characters. You know, those robotic, animal-like things?   Yea...I need to warn you about those. They...um...tend to get a bit...irritable...at night. So... be careful. </p>

<h3>
